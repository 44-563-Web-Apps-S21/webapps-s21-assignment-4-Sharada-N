                <p>Enter PETRUCHIO</p>
                <h5>PETRUCHIO</h5>
                <p>Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
                Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!</p>
                <p>Enter KATHARINA</p>
                <h5>KATHARINA</h5>
                <p>The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.</p>
                <h5>PETRUCHIO</h5>
                <p>I say it is the moon that shines so bright.</p>
                <h5>KATHARINA</h5>
                <p>I know it is the sun that shines so bright.</p>
                <h5>PETRUCHIO</h5>
                <p>Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
                It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
                Or ere I journey to your father's house.
                Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
                Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!</p>
                <p>Enter HORTENSIO</p>
                <h5>HORTENSIO</h5>
                <p>Say as he says, or we shall never go.</p>
                <h5>KATHARINA</h5>
                <p>Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
                And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
                An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
                Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.</p>
                <h5>PETRUCHIO</h5>
                <p>I say it is the moon.</p>

                <p>I know it is the moon.</p>
